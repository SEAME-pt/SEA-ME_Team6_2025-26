## About
**SEAME** is a learning-by-building initiative focused on the **software engineering of automotive/mobility systems**.  
We’re practicing a **end-to-end engineering flow**:

- **Platform:** we assemble a **Raspberry Pi 5 + PiRacer** setup (camera, display, controller, optional Hailo accelerator) and build a **Qt-based UI** (driver info, status).
- **Engineering practices:** we structure work through **issues/epics → branches → PRs → CI → documentation**, keeping **TSF-style traceability** between requirements, code, and tests.
- **Automation:** we use **GitHub Actions** for repeatable checks and documentation helpers.
- **Organization:** we work in **sprints**, doing small increments, and maintain a clear **Project board** so anyone can see scope, status, and blockers.

---

## Scope
- **Platform setup:** RPi5, camera, display, Hailo Hat.
- **Workflows & docs:** GitHub Actions, PR templates, TSF traceability.

---

## Current Phase
**Sprint 1** → Hardware setup, Project setup, labels/board, first Qt UI skeleton.  

---

## How We Work
**Branches**
- `main` → protected  
- `dev` → integration branch  
- `#<issue>-<epic>/<name>` → feature branches from `dev` (e.g., `#12-QtApp-mockup`)
