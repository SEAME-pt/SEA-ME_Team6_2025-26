I have a C++ code file. Please analyze it and generate structured documentation for each function with the following:

1. Brief description
2. Parameters (name, type, description)
3. Return value (type, description)
4. Signals emitted (if Qt code)

Format rules:
- Use @brief:, @param:, @return:, and @signals: with a colon followed by the description.
- Parameters must include name, type, and description.
- Return must include type and description.
- Signals must show the name and when it is emitted.
- Keep the formatting consistent, like this example:

/**
 * @brief: Brief description of the function.
 *
 * @param paramName: (Type) Description of the parameter.
 * @return: ReturnType Description of the return value.
 * @signals: signalName() Description of when the signal is emitted (if applicable).
 */

Code example:
```cpp

```
