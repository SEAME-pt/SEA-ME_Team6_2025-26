# TSF Implementation Guide — Sea:ME

This document describes the exact steps and commands to maintain and publish the project TSF using `trudag`.

Prerequisites
- `python3` (3.9+ recommended)
- `trudag` installed and available in PATH on the machine that will publish
- `graphviz` (`dot`) if you want to render `graph/graph.dot`

Quick commands

- Generate items from requirements (creates/updates EXPECT/ASSERT/EVID skeletons):

```bash
python3 docs/TSF/tsf_implementation/scripts/generate_from_requirements.py --input docs/TSF/requirements/LO_requirements.md
```

- Run local validation of items:

```bash
python3 docs/TSF/tsf_implementation/validators/validate_front_matter.py
```

- Create items in trudag and publish (local machine with trudag):

```bash
bash docs/TSF/tsf_implementation/scripts/run_trudag_publish.sh
```

CI (GitHub Actions)
- A CI workflow (`.github/workflows/tsf-ci.yml`) is included which runs the generator and validators on PRs to `development`. To enable automatic publishing, configure a runner with `trudag` and set `TRUDAG_AUTO_PUBLISH=true` in secrets (optional).

Automation notes
- The generator will try to match evidences automatically by scanning `docs/sprints/`, `docs/demos/`, `docs/guides/`, `docs/images/`, and `src/`. Matches are suggestions — review before publishing.
- The final `.dotstop.dot` manifest with SHAs is generated by `trudag publish` — the generator creates/updates items and `graph/graph.dot` and the `run_trudag_publish.sh` script runs the `trudag` flow.

If you want, I can now run the generator to create the initial EXPECT/ASSERT/EVID skeletons and create the graph. Approve and I will run it and show the created files.
