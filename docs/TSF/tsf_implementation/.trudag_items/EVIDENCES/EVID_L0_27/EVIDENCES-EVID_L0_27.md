header: "Emergency Braking Distance Evidence"
text: |
  Evidence demonstrating that the emergency braking system actuates correctly and stops the vehicle at a safe distance from detected obstacles, with a minimum remaining distance of ≥ 50 mm when an obstacle is detected at 300 mm.

  **Verification Method:** Integration test. Measure the distance between the vehicle and the obstacle after full stop. Video recording of the test execution.

  **Expected Artifacts:**
  - Video recording of emergency braking test execution
  - Distance measurements (before and after braking)
  - Obstacle detection sensor logs
  - Braking actuation timing logs
  - Multiple test run results for repeatability
