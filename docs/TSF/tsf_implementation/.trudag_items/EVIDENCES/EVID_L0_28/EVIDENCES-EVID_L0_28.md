header: "Temperature Measurement Accuracy Evidence"
text: |
  Evidence demonstrating that the system measures the exterior temperature with a maximum deviation of ±2 °C from the reference temperature.

  **Verification Method:** Integration test. Measure the actual exterior temperature using a calibrated thermometer. Compare the reference value with the system-reported temperature. Video or image evidence of the measurement setup.

  **Expected Artifacts:**
  - Photos of measurement setup with calibrated thermometer
  - Comparison table of reference vs. system-reported temperatures
  - Temperature sensor readings log
  - Calibration certificate or specifications of reference thermometer
  - Multiple measurement results at different temperatures
