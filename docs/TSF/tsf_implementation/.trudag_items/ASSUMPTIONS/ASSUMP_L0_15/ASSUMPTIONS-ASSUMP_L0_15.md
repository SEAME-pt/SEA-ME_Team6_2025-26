GitHub Projects and Agile/Scrum methodology documentation are accessible for self-training before agile process adoption begins.

Acceptance criteria / notes:
- GitHub Projects is enabled and accessible for the repository.
- Agile and Scrum training materials (online resources, books, documentation) are accessible to team members.
- Team members complete individual self-training on Agile/Scrum methodologies.
- Sprint schedules and ceremonies (standup, review, retrospective) are defined by the team.

Rationale: Agile process adoption for `EXPECT-L0-15` depends on GitHub Projects tooling availability and individual self-training on Agile/Scrum methodologies. This assumption clarifies that the project uses GitHub Projects exclusively and relies on self-directed learning.
