Hardware components (Raspberry Pi 5, Raspberry Pi 4, STM32, Hailo AI Hat, motors, sensors) are procured and available before system architecture implementation begins.

Acceptance criteria / notes:
- All hardware components listed in the architecture have been purchased or provided.
- Components are received and physically available in the project workspace.
- Component specifications match the planned architecture requirements.

Rationale: Architecture implementation for `EXPECT-L0-10` depends on hardware availability. This assumption makes explicit that hardware procurement is a prerequisite for architecture realization.
