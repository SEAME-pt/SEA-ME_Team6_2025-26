The required hardware components (Expansion Board, Raspberry Pi 5, Raspberry Pi 4, DC motors, servo motor, display interfaces, chassis) are procured and available before hardware assembly activities begin.

Acceptance criteria / notes:
- All hardware components have been purchased or provided by the organization.
- Components are received and physically available in the project workspace.
- Component specifications match the system architecture requirements.

Rationale: Hardware assembly for `EXPECT-L0-2` depends on external procurement of components. This assumption makes explicit that hardware availability is a prerequisite for assembly work.
