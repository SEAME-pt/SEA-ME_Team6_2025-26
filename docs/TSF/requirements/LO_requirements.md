# Level 0 (Client) Requirements — PiRacer Warm-Up Project

This document defines the **Level 0 (Client) Requirements** for the PiRacer Warm-Up module.  
Each requirement is written from the client’s perspective, includes measurable acceptance criteria,  
and is testable and traceable to the system architecture and corresponding test cases.  
These requirements establish the scope, priorities, and evaluation criteria for the project.

## Overview

The PiRacer Warm-Up project aims to familiarize students with:
- The **PiRacer robot hardware**, including the Raspberry Pi 5, Hailo AI Hat, DC and servo motors, and built-in display.
- The development of a **simple Qt-based graphical application** running on the PiRacer’s display.
- The use of **Git and GitHub** for collaborative software development.
- The application of **Agile (Scrum)** methodologies for team organization and project management.
- The integration of the **Trustable Software Framework (TSF)** to ensure traceability between requirements, design, and testing.

## Traceability and Verification

Each Level 0 requirement shall be traceable to:
- **System Architecture Elements** — defining how each requirement is implemented.
- **Level 1 Software Requirements** — specifying the detailed functional behavior.
- **Test Cases** — verifying that each requirement is met and validated.

Traceability will be maintained within the GitHub repository, following the principles of the **Trustable Software Framework (TSF)**.
