| 13/10/2025 | João  **SPRINT PLANNING** | 1. Hardware setup<br>2. Software setup<br>3. GitHub Actions<br>4. TSF<br>5. Qt and cross-compilation — with repo setup and project board creation | In progress/To be done, no issues                                                                                    | Waiting for Victor’s authorization for GitHub Actions and PRs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 15/10/2025 | João  **STANDUP MEETING**  | **Daily Goals** <br> 1. Setup<br>2. Install Hailo<br>3. Connect CSI<br>4. Connect DSI<br>5. Connect gamepad and install dependencies | **Done** <br> 1. Set almost ready and almost fully tested<br>2. Raspberry Pi Bookworm installed<br>3. Hailo Hat 8 installed [](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-rpi5-examples)<br>5. DSI connected and working<br>6. Gamepad and dongle connected and working with dependencies installed<br><br> **In Progress/To be done** <br>7. Missing: connect everything to the expansion board (need to buy headers) | **BLOCKERS** <br> Waiting for Victor’s authorization for GitHub Actions and PRs<br><br>**Weekly Meeting Notes** Questions for David (with answers):<br>1. Things we need to buy for the car — should we buy them ourselves and present an expense note? (Yes, we can buy them: headers, original Raspberry charger €34 5V/5A, longer DSI cables, multiple microHDMI adapters, Raspberry Pi 5 heatsinks/fans)<br>2. I’m responsible for making an inventory of what all groups need and sending it to Filipe tomorrow. He’ll meet Maria and handle purchases.<br>3. Split big tasks across sprints (Epics). Tasks must be sprint-specific; otherwise, they’re too large and must be divided.<br>4. TSF requires a traceability matrix (PB1→L0→L1→L2→L3→Test Cases)? → Yes, that’s correct.<br>5. We’re on the right path; Filipe said Dana will prepare a session tomorrow.<br>6. Should we choose between AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) or Android Automotive OS? Or can we use others like Eclipse ThreadX? → We should use **AGL (for Raspberry)** and **ThreadX (for the microcontroller)**.<br>7. Pedro suggested connecting the motors to the microcontroller later. For now, keep them as-is, but plan for it later — the powertrain should stay with the microcontroller. Later, create a communication layer between the Raspberry and microcontroller (e.g., using uProtocol). It could be bidirectional.<br>8. Which warmup week are we in? → The previous one was week 0 (or -1); this is the first week of Sprint 1. There are two sprints in Module 0. We’re ahead (very good).<br>9. Power problems: we can use two separate battery sets or voltage regulators. Later, we can calculate total power usage theoretically using hardware specs.<br>10. Hardware has power specifications; we can measure via oscilloscope or theoretical calculation.<br>11. TSF nomenclature must be used (L0, L1, etc.).<br>12. Talk to Victor for permissions (PR rules, GitHub Actions workflows).<br>13. Miguel’s group can’t connect Wi-Fi (kernel config issue). If we use Raspberry Wi-Fi, we might face the same problem — needs solving.<br>14. Scrum: we can choose what works best for the group (daily reports, etc.) — keep it simple (KISS).<br>15. Asked if each task requires documentation — yes, as discussed, in the issue. Suggested extra traceability documentation backup (agreed). |

| **19/11/2025** | **Joao** | Continued implementation of the items mentioned on the previous day<br>**Victory of today** - unidirectional communication between STM32 and Raspberry Pi | In Progress / To be Done | **Standup Meeting (Paulo) Notes**<br>**Team Updates:**<br>- Group 2: blockage in wheel connection via I²C — unable to establish communication.<br>- DrivaPi group: difficulties booting from SSD; Filipe will assist; if we have the same problem, coordinate with them.<br>**Workflow & GitHub:** suggestion to run a linter (e.g., clang-tidy) only on changed code in PRs via GitHub Actions.<br>Keep issues well-described and linked; tag Filipe, Paulo or Pedro in issues.<br>Keep the GitHub board updated: To Do → In Progress → Done. Suggest changing views to iterations.<br>**Technical Development:** ThreadX must ensure control of motor, servos, sensor and CAN; some teams facing difficulties.<br>Filipe will ask Pete A. Zouk for another example of a TSF implementation 🎉 |
