| 15/10/2025 | João (Weekly Meeting)   | 1. Setup<br>2. Install Hailo<br>3. Connect CSI<br>4. Connect DSI<br>5. Connect gamepad and install dependencies | 1. Set almost ready and almost fully tested<br>2. Raspberry Pi Bookworm installed<br>3. Hailo Hat 8 installed [](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-rpi5-examples)<br>5. DSI connected and working<br>6. Gamepad and dongle connected and working with dependencies installed<br>7. Missing: connect everything to the expansion board (need to buy headers) | **Waiting for Victor’s authorization for GitHub Actions and PRs**<br><br>**Questions for David (with answers):**<br>1. Things we need to buy for the car — should we buy them ourselves and present an expense note? (Yes, we can buy them: headers, original Raspberry charger €34 5V/5A, longer DSI cables, multiple microHDMI adapters, Raspberry Pi 5 heatsinks/fans)<br>2. I’m responsible for making an inventory of what all groups need and sending it to Filipe tomorrow. He’ll meet Maria and handle purchases.<br>3. Split big tasks across sprints (Epics). Tasks must be sprint-specific; otherwise, they’re too large and must be divided.<br>4. TSF requires a traceability matrix (PB1→L0→L1→L2→L3→Test Cases)? → Yes, that’s correct.<br>5. We’re on the right path; Filipe said Dana will prepare a session tomorrow.<br>6. Should we choose between AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) or Android Automotive OS? Or can we use others like Eclipse ThreadX? → We should use **AGL (for Raspberry)** and **ThreadX (for the microcontroller)**.<br>7. Pedro suggested connecting the motors to the microcontroller later. For now, keep them as-is, but plan for it later — the powertrain should stay with the microcontroller. Later, create a communication layer between the Raspberry and microcontroller (e.g., using uProtocol). It could be bidirectional.<br>8. Which warmup week are we in? → The previous one was week 0 (or -1); this is the first week of Sprint 1. There are two sprints in Module 0. We’re ahead (very good).<br>9. Power problems: we can use two separate battery sets or voltage regulators. Later, we can calculate total power usage theoretically using hardware specs.<br>10. Hardware has power specifications; we can measure via oscilloscope or theoretical calculation.<br>11. TSF nomenclature must be used (L0, L1, etc.).<br>12. Talk to Victor for permissions (PR rules, GitHub Actions workflows).<br>13. Miguel’s group can’t connect Wi-Fi (kernel config issue). If we use Raspberry Wi-Fi, we might face the same problem — needs solving.<br>14. Scrum: we can choose what works best for the group (daily reports, etc.) — keep it simple (KISS).<br>15. Asked if each task requires documentation — yes, as discussed, in the issue. Suggested extra traceability documentation backup (agreed). |

| 29/10/2025 | Diogo (Weekly Meeting)  | Continue with **Sprint planning execution:**<br> 1 - Architecture (software + hardware): AGL, ThreadX, CanBus, uProtocol<br> 2 - Remove expansion board and link motors directly to microcontroller<br> 3 - Implement TSF on GitHub<br> 4 - Qt and cross-compilation<br> 5 - Study next module and link to current one<br> 6 - Engineering process refinement <br> <br> **Daily goals** <br> <br> 1 - Surpass Car blocker <br> 2 - Continue QT crosscompilation <br> 3 - Continue TSF implementation <br> 4 - Weekly Meeting Preparation <br> 5 - Update Daily <br> | In progress, no issues                                                                                    | **Blockers:**<br>• 1. Waiting for Victor’s authorization for GitHub Actions and PRs<br>• 2. Shop still missing: headers, original Raspberry charger €34 5V/5A, longer DSI cables, multiple microHDMI adapters, Raspberry Pi 5 heatsinks/fans<br>• 3. Car doesn’t work: possible software problem<br><br>**Suggestions:**<br>• 1. Removing expansion board<br>• 2. Power management: research and plan system design (Battery Management System + Buck-Boost Regulator + Power Distribution Board with independent fuses)<br>• Powertrain should stay with the microcontroller. Later, create a communication layer between the Raspberry and microcontroller (e.g., using uProtocol). It could be bidirectional.<br>• 3. Understanding Qt cross-compilation<br>• Integrating Qt within the DSI display<br><br>**Next Module Issues:**<br>• 1. AGL: research what Yocto is (Linux distribution builder)<br>• 2. CAN communication: use CAN, not CAN-FD<br>• 3. CAN communication setup: RASP → MF2515 → CAN cable → MF2515 → STM32<br>• 4. I2C/SPI/GPIO libraries: research and use Eclipse uProtocol<br>• 5. Meetings: TSF → Nov 6; ThreadX → Nov 4/11/14 (TBD); Architecture Blueprints Eclipse → TBD; OpenHardware Workshop → TBD |
