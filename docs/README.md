# Project documentation

This folder (`docs/`) contains learning materials, guides, demos and the TSF implementation artifacts for the project.

Structure (high level):
- `contents_2025/` course contents
- `dailys/`, `demos/`, `guides/`, `sprints/`
- `TSF/` traceability and requirements files

This README is intentionally lightweight; expand with cross-links to module-level READMEs as needed.
