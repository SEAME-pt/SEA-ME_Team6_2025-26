## 👋 Introduction

This document outlines the testing framework selection process for the project. Our system combines embedded C/C++ running on ThreadX with a Qt-based user interface, requiring a comprehensive testing strategy that addresses both domains.  
The goal is to identify appropriate testing frameworks that can:
 - Validate C/C++ code for the control systems.
 - Test the Qt GUI interface for usability and functionality.
 - Integrate with our development workflow and CI/CD pipeline.
 - Support both unit and integration testing approaches.

This guide analyzes our specific context, evaluates suitable frameworks and recommends a practical testing strategy tailored to our project needs.
